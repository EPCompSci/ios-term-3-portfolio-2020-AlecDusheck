I have a high amount of real-world experiece with iOS app development. 
I use Flutter at a company I work for to develop mobile applications for a wide variety of clients.

In addition to back-end programming, I'm also passionate about UI design. I've experiemented with serval different design languages and am always looking for better ways to convay information to users.

I've worked on several personal projects including Simply Servers, a full-on server management platform. This project included a horizontally scalable management engine, which is powered by Docker. It also included a full-fledged API and an Angular front-end. While never deployed, this project was fully functional and completed.
